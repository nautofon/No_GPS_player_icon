[normal]The [orange]No GPS player icon [normal]mod hides the blue triangle "GPS fix" icon which is used to indicate the player's position on the world map.

This may be useful when playing with no navigation, because opening the world map to e.g. search for a gas station is less likely to "spoil" your current position.

[orange]Limitation:

[normal]The same icon that is used on the world map is also used in the Route Advisor and the truck's 3D-rendered navigation display. Installing this mod will hide the icon everywhere.

[orange]Compatibility:

[normal]Tested with ATS 1.42 through 1.45. Likely compatible with a wide range of ATS and ETS2 versions. Can be added and removed with no ill effects; the icon simply re-appears upon mod removal.

## Hide player position

The **Hide player position** mod is a variant of the
[No GPS player icon](https://github.com/nautofon/No_GPS_player_icon)
mod that not only hides the blue triangle "GPS fix" icon, but also makes
all undiscovered roads yellow.

This may be useful when exploring new areas while playing with no navigation,
because opening the world map to e.g. search for a gas station is *even
less* likely to "spoil" your current position. The end of the yellow part
of the road might otherwise spoil your current position just as much as
the blue icon would.

### Variants

There are currently two variants of this mod:

*	[No GPS player icon](https://github.com/nautofon/No_GPS_player_icon)
	only hides the player icon; maximum compatibility

*	[Hide player position](https://github.com/nautofon/No_GPS_player_icon/tree/Hide_player_position)
	**(this variant)**
	also makes all roads yellow; less compatible

### Limitation

The same icon that is used on the world map is also used in the Route Advisor
and the truck's 3D-rendered navigation display. Installing this mod will hide
the icon everywhere.

### Download and Installation

Please see the [Releases](https://github.com/nautofon/No_GPS_player_icon/releases)
section on GitHub for download links.

The file you download for this variant is named `Hide_player_position.scs`.
To install the mod, simply place it into your game's `mod` directory and
activate it in the Mod Manager, which is accessible from the game's title
screen. The location of the game's `mod` directory depends on your platform:

* on macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/American Truck Simulator/mod`
* on Linux: `~/.local/share/American Truck Simulator/mod`
* on Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\American Truck Simulator\mod`

Note that the mod file name does not contain a version number.
This will make it easier for you to upgrade the mod to later versions.

## No GPS player icon

The **No GPS player icon** mod hides the blue triangle "GPS fix" icon
which is used to indicate the player's position on the world map.

This may be useful when playing with no navigation, because opening the
world map to e.g. search for a gas station is less likely to "spoil" your
current position. The world map will usually still open with the view
centered on your current position, but without the player icon, the exact
position is less obvious.

### Variants

There are currently two variants of this mod:

*	[No GPS player icon](https://github.com/nautofon/No_GPS_player_icon)
	**(this variant)**
	only hides the player icon; maximum compatibility

*	[Hide player position](https://github.com/nautofon/No_GPS_player_icon/tree/Hide_player_position)
	also makes all roads yellow; less compatible

### Limitation

The same icon that is used on the world map is also used in the Route Advisor
and the truck's 3D-rendered navigation display. Installing this mod will hide
the icon everywhere.
